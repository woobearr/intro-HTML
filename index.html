    <p style="">Get Up is the second extended play (EP) by South Korean girl group NewJeans. It was released by ADOR through YG Plus on July 21, 2023, more than six months after their previous album, OMG. Composed of six tracks, the EP was produced by long-time collaborators Park Jin-su and 250, along with Frankie Scoca, Catharina Stoltenberg, and Henriette Motzfeldt.</p>
    <p>Get Up was supported by three singles, "Super Shy", "ETA" and "Cool with You", the first of which was released on July 7, 2023. All six tracks received music videos, which attracted attention for featuring collaborations with multiple brands such as Apple and the The Powerpuff Girls,[clarification needed] and celebrities such as Hoyeon Jung and Tony Leung. NewJeans promoted the EP through a worldwide marketing campaign developed in collaboration with Spotify and numerous performances on South Korean music programs.</p>
    <p>Upon its release, Get Up received positive reviews from music critics. The EP debuted at number two on South Korea's Circle Album Chart and sold 1.65 million copies in its first week of release, becoming the group's third consecutive album to sell over one million copies and the second most-sold album by a K-pop female artist in its first week of release.</p>
